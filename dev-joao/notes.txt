i am using min count for procruste of 100

2.3 Aligning historical embeddings -> says that the alignemnts are between pairs of learned embeddings
but in practice they are accumulated over the years --> accumulate errors?
it also accumulates the intersections of vocabs, so each decade has less vocab than before

it seems like all the embeddings are already normalized
does this affect the correlations matrix and, therefore, the softcos?
